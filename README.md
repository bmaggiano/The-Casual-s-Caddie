# The Casuals Caddie

## Description

This app is a full stack app designed to help the weekend warrior keep track of their golfing distances. Wether you're a PGA tour pro, an ametuer, or somewhere in the middle... keeping track of your distances is one of the most important features of golf.

With The Casual's Caddie, users are able to log in/sign up, add clubs to their virtual bag, drive to their local TopTracer driving range, hit balls, input data and get an average distance, high distance, and low distance for their clubs. So next time they're on the tee box of a par 3 that's 181 yards, there will be no more confusion about "should I go with the 7 or the 6 iron here, Brandon?".
